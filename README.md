# FPL-Statbot
It is a web application, which will fetch information based on user query related to the English Premier League and give them accurate results for what they have searched. 
To provide the results and identify the queries, various NLP models will be used and the information will be extracted from the official FPL API of the English Premier League. 
For example, if the user searches who is Liverpoolâ€™s highest scorer in the current season, we will extract the name of the highest scorer after analyzing the data received from the FPL API. 
This application will also provide recommendations regarding what transfers to make, captaincy options etc. based on the current season statistics as well as considering the previous season statistics. 
This would help FPL managers make informed decisions and score higher points in each game week. 
It can also suggest which players to pick using a unique custom formula that helps in live win prediction analyzing past and real time data.
